<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


*  Creates a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
*  Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color.
*  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and earthquakes with greater depth are darker in color.
*  Popups provide additional information about the earthquake including magnitude, location and depth.
*  The legend provides data on earthquake depth.
